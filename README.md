# CRM_Dataset_Preparation

This repository contains a practical exercise completed as part of the **Complete Data Analyst Training: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Data Collection, Preprocessing, Data Types, Data Visualization** course on **Udemy**, developed by **365 Careers**.

**Project Overview**

In this project, we assume the role of a Data Analyst within the Data Science Team of a central bank in Europe.

The teamâ€™s objective is to develop a credit risk model that estimates the probability of default for personal accounts.

Our responsibility is to prepare the loan dataset for analysis and modeling by performing thorough data cleaning and preprocessing using NumPy.

**Objectives**

1. Examine and import the raw dataset (loan-data.csv).

2. Clean and preprocess data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

3. Convert monetary values from USD to EUR.

4. Transform categorical variables into numerical form through encoding or dummy variable creation.

5. Handle missing values following risk-averse business rules defined by the data science team.

6. Document all transformations and export a finalized dataset for use in model development.

**Methodology**

The preprocessing tasks include:

1. Currency Conversion: Adjusting all financial values from USD to EUR.

2. Categorical Encoding: Converting qualitative information into numeric representations.

3. Date Transformation: Extracting relevant time components (e.g., month of loan issue).

4. Missing Data Handling: Applying column-specific imputation strategies reflecting conservative lending policies.

5. Data Export: Saving the clean, structured dataset to a new CSV file for downstream modeling.

**Technologies Used**

> Python

> NumPy 

> Google Colab 

**Tip**:
When writing your code in Google Colab, include clear comments before each code cell.

This helps Gemini AI provide context-aware recommendations and code suggestions as you type.

**Result**

The final output of this project is a fully cleaned and preprocessed dataset exported in .csv format.

Along with otheer intermediate datasets prepared during the process.

This dataset is ready for use by the data science team to build predictive credit risk and probability of default models.
